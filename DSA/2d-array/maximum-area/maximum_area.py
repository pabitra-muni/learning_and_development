def maximalSquare(matrix: list[list[str]]) -> int:
    """
    This function calculates the area of the largest square containing only 1's in a given 2D binary matrix.
    The algorithm uses dynamic programming to solve the problem efficiently. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

    1. Determine the number of rows (rowCount) and columns (colCount) in the matrix.
    2. Initialize a 2D list (dp) of size (rowCount+1) x (colCount+1) with all elements set to 0. This list will store the side length of the
      largest square ending at each cell.
    3. Initialize a variable (maxSide) to keep track of the maximum side length of the square found so far.
    4. Iterate through each cell in the matrix using nested loops:
        a. For each cell (i, j), if the cell contains a '1', update dp[i+1][j+1] to the minimum of the values in the cells to 
        the left, top, and top-left diagonal of the current cell in the dp array, plus 1.
        b. Update maxSide to be the maximum of its current value and dp[i+1][j+1].
    5. After processing all cells, the area of the largest square is given by maxSide * maxSide.
    6. Return the area of the largest square as the result.

    Example:
    Consider the following matrix:
    [
        ["1", "0", "1", "0", "0"],
        ["1", "0", "1", "1", "1"],
        ["1", "1", "1", "1", "1"],
        ["1", "0", "0", "1", "0"]
    ]
    The dp array will be updated as follows:
    Initial dp: 
    [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    After processing the matrix, dp will be:
    [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    ]
    The maximum side length of the square is 2, so the area is 4.

    :param matrix: A 2D list of strings representing the binary matrix.
    :return: The area of the largest square containing only 1's.
